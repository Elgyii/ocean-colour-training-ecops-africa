# Ocean colour remote sensing and data analysis course for early career ocean professionals in Africa

*** 

### Overview

The online training course on Ocean Colour Remote Sensing and Data Analysis is envisioned to be an introductory course
for marine environment conservation for African Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs) leveraging the use of ocean
colour remote sensing as a tool for marine environment protection and conservation. With this initiative our aim is to
contribute to the call for Decade Actions from the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development by
focussing on addressing the Ocean Challenges 1 and 7. The online course will consist of a series of webinars introducing
topics on water quality monitoring by ocean colour remote sensing. The webinars will include lectures by invited experts
and hands-on tutorial sessions on analysis of satellite data for the African ECOPs to gain useful skills and knowledge
in utilizing remote sensing data for monitoring and assessing the coastal and marine environment. The objectives of the
training are as follows:

- Understand the satellite-derived parameters used in water quality monitoring.
- Learn to search and retrieve satellite data from data providers like NASA.
- Analyse and apply satellite data for water quality monitoring and other marine related activities for ocean
  conservation.

### Duration

The online course will consist of a series of webinars, hands-on, Q&A and presentation sessions held within a period of
three weeks. Active sessions (students and the trainers) will run for a maximum of 2 hours according to the program
while the students will have other individual time to work on their projects.

---

### Tools

The training will be online whereby OTGA platform will be the main communication tool used. As for the hands-on, they
will be based on Jupyter notebooks and Python programming language to process and analyse satellite data. The Jupyter
Notebooks interface is a web-based application that allows the combination of live-code with narrative text, equations,
and visualizations. The Python programming language is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language
design to emphasize code readability. Python contains a vast array of packages freely available that do all sorts of
things that oceanographers, marine sciences, and the like scientists do.

### Participants

The training is aimed at African early career ocean professionals leveraging the use of ocean colour remote sensing as a
tool for marine environment protection and conservation. Besides, the training is also a good network opportunity and
knowledge exchange.

---

### Pre-requisites

All hands-on use Jupyter Notebooks to run Python code. Participants will be required to install Jupyter Notebook or use
online tools. Prior knowledge in ocean colour data processing is not required. A pre-session that will guide
participants on how to install Jupyter Notebooks will be organised prior to the training course.

### Agenda (June 6th â€“ 24th 2022)
Meetings are scheduled for 10:00 AM to 12:00 Noon Nairobi Time
